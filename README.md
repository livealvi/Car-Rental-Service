 # About This Project
Presently there is a rapid growth of demand for car usage on specific occasions and events. But many people do not own a car or they do not own a car suited for the specific event in question. On the other hand, there are car owners who do not have regular usage of their cars. It can be beneficial for both parties can get an economic advantage by using each other’s resources and necessities.

So, the aim of our project is to bring together car owners and car renters through a platform as a car rental service. The car renters can rent to the interested renters in a secured manner since a verification system for the renter (through documents like NID / Driving License), as well as the car owner (Car Registration / Insurance information), will be implemented.

This project will demonstrate a basic design of the platform which can be extended later based on business requirements and needs.
